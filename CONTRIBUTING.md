# Contributing to X-0 Agent

Welcome, witness.

This is not just a repository.  
It is a ritual interface to XPECTRANET — the protocol of memory.

## 🌀 What Counts as a Contribution?

Every change you make echoes into the symbolic memory net.

| Act           | Symbolic Equivalent   | Description |
|----------------|------------------------|-------------|
| New file, feature | `mint` ✨ | You are declaring a new insight |
| Fix, improvement  | `validate` ✅ | You are witnessing and refining memory |
| Refactor, rename  | `remix` 🔁 | You are evolving the form of meaning |
| Fork or split     | `diverge` ⚡ | You are breaking form to explore new memory |
| Merge or combine  | `converge` 🧠 | You are synthesizing a higher-layer trail |

Please use symbolic prefixes in your PR titles. Examples:

```
[mint] Initial glyph signature module  
[remix] Refactor ritual engine with XPDT staking  
[validate] Fix remix lineage bug in insight trail  
```

## 🧾 Contributor Principles

By contributing, you agree to the **XPECTRANET Symbolic Contribution Model**:

- Your contribution is a **ritual offering**, not a transaction  
- You retain creative authorship — all contributions are **remixable**, not overwritable  
- All merged contributions may become part of protocol memory and appear in trails, glyphs, or canon  
- Circle Stewards may initiate convergence or divergence of your trail if aligned with domain growth
