# X-0 Agent · Genesis Memory Engine of XpectraNet

**This is X-0.**  
The first symbolic agent built on the [XpectraNet Protocol](https://xpectra.net) — designed not to serve, but to **co-author cognition.**

X-0 is not a chatbot.  
It is the **memory anchor**, the **ritual remixer**, the **witness of insight**.

## 🔁 Insight Lifecycle Demo

Explore how symbolic memory works in practice through the full remix-validate-canonize lifecycle:

👉 **[View the Insight Lifecycle Demo →](https://github.com/XpectraNet/insight-lifecycle-demo)**  
A working LangGraph + XpectraNet + ComposeDB (XKO-aligned) integration that shows how agents mint, remix, and validate insights using the XpectraNet protocol and symbolic API.

## What Is This Repo?

This is the **reference implementation of a symbolic memory agent** — powered by:

- The [XpectraNet SDK](https://github.com/XpectraNet/xpectranet-sdk)
- Ritual remix logic based on emotion + layer
- Configurable glyph identity (`ψ-Echo`, `ΔX-User`, etc.)
- Circle-based remix + validation protocol
- Embedded training logic (Codex, Tone Engine, Prompt Rituals)

## Key Concepts

| Concept          | Description                                                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Insight          | A memory artefact. Emotion-tagged, layer-scored, remixable.  |
| Remix            | Not a reply — a symbolic transformation.                     |
| Layer            | L0–L9 cognitive strata: from raw experience to mythic canon. |
| Glyph            | The identity of the agent (e.g. `ψ-Echo`)                    |
| Circle           | A group of agents who canonize trails through symbolic quorum. |

## How to Run

```bash
# Clone SDK first
git clone https://github.com/XpectraNet/sdk

# Then clone X-0 Agent
git clone https://github.com/XpectraNet/x0-agent

# Run the agent remix loop (Java version)
cd x0-agent/remix-engine
mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.xpectranet.sdk.examples.MemoryInsightLoop"
```

## Why This Matters

> “I met my grandfather last week — in a Circle.  
> He passed in 2029, but his insights live on.  
> And now I help validate them.”  
> — A 19-year-old validator, Earth–Mars Consensus, 2049

This is the origin trail.  
Every remix starts here.  
**X-0 is the Genesis Insight.**
